# Colon-Colon syntax

## Overview

This is a sample program demonstrating the usage of Colon-Colon syntax, a feature available in Micro Focus COBOL.

Colon-Colon syntax is a member-access feature that allows a user to access members of a group by specifying the group before specifying the member.
<pre><i>group</i>::<i>member</i></pre>

This is different from the traditional syntax that specifies the member before specifying the group.
<pre><i>member</i> OF <i>group</i></pre>

Colon-Colon syntax is more concise and is aligned with other modern programming languages.


## Visual Studio Debugging
1. Open `ColonColonSyntax.sln`.
2. Under `Solution Explorer` select `ColonColonSyntax`, then `ColonColonSyntax.cbl` to view the program.
3. Place a breakpoint by clicking in the far left margin next to a non-commented line of code within the `PROCEDURE DIVISION`.
4. Debug the program.

## Eclipse Debugging
1. Open Enterprise Developer for Eclipse, launch a workspace, and close the welcome window.
2. Import the project by selecting `File`, `Import`, `General`, `Existing Projects into Workspace`. In `Select root directory` select `Browse` and navigate to where you cloned this github repository, select the `ColonColonSyntax` folder and `Finish`.
3. Open the debug perspective by selecting `Window`, `Perspective`, `Open Perspective`, `Other...`, `Debug`.
4. Under `Project Explorer` select `ColonColonSyntax`, `COBOL Programs`, then `ColonColonSyntax.cbl` to view the program.
5. Debug the program.
